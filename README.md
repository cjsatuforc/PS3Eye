So, to use the PS3Eye-Library you need to install the corresponding PS3Eye driver for your OS.

#### How i did it (Windows 10, x64)
1) plugin PS3Eye-USB-Camera
2) open the Device Manager and open [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie/)
3) make sure no driver is installed (uninstall if necessary) and then use Zadig to install **libus-win32**
